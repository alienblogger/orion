A Minimalist's Music Player â™ª

This player was built for me to use with steam when I'm gaming and is thus very minimal since I didn't want the steam browser to go crazy. It is very minimal and uses [music-server](https://github.com/barelyhuman/music-server) as it's backend to search through youtube and also to import the spotify playlist tracks.

## Features

- Single Infinite looped Queue (non stop music for those warm up gaming session)
- Import tracks from Spotify Playlists (cause you might not be a fan of searching for tracks again and again)
- Browser specific storage (the reason why it's free to use)
- Minimal (like everything else you'll find on [barelyhuman](https://github.com/barelyhuman))
- Dark Mode (apparently this a feature now)

## Stack

The app is built with just next.js and few custom hooks and contexts that you can find in the code , the backend source can be found on [music-server](https://github.com/barelyhuman/music-server)
